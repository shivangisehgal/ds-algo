//Method 2: Using only one stack
//Keep going to the left (and pushing in stack)/
//When current node becomes NULL (obviously its root will be the top of stack), check if right subtree exists for its root
//if it does, update current node to the root's (top of stack's) right subtree
//else, if right subtree is also NULL, print the root (top of stack)
//and check if popped node is the right child of top of stack. If it isn't go to right of top of stack.

//LEAF -> print, CHECK IF RIGHT EXISTS FOR ITS ROOT, IF YES, UPDATE CURRENT
